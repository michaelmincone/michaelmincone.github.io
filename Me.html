   <p>
<font size="4">My name is Michael Mincone and I am a student attending the University at Buffalo.
  I am majoring in Computer Science and I am so excited to learn how to master the art of coding.
  This website is my first baby steps into HTML and so far I think this is really cool. I am 18 years old.
